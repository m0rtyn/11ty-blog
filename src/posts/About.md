**So Meta** is [Martyn's](https://someta.site/about-martyn) blog about wanting to see the world from the outside.

# ‚≠êÔ∏è For what

- I want to understand reality more accurately.
- I want to act less wrong.
- I want to get high from understanding complex patterns

# üß† Why

People can perceive themselves from the outside. An advanced brain is responsible for this ability, but it has a number of vulnerabilities. And in part, they can be dealt with on their own (no*).

Here are some of the brain errors: survivor error, accessibility heuristics, and the illusion of control. In all, cognitive distortions have been described [more than a hundred](https://www.wikiwand.com/ru/%D0%A1%D0%BF%D0%B8%D1%81%D0%BE%D0%BA_%D0%BA%D0%BE%D0%B3%D0%BD%D0%B8%D1%82%D0%B8%D0%B2%D0%BD%D1%8B%D1%85_%D0%B8%D1%81%D0%BA%D0%B0%D0%B6%D0%B5%D0%BD%D0%B8%D0%B9) and are found in most people.

By understanding distortions, I can spot them and if not prevent them, at least correct them in time. Therefore, while studying rationality, I quickly felt the benefit in cases where I was able to direct something in a desired direction.
