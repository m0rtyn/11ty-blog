I’m Mártyn. Literally a programmer, figuratively ~~a dog~~ an artist.

## ℹ️ 

I’m around 30 years old, a frontend developer, and project manager.

I’ve lived in Lensk (Yakutia) → Novosibirsk → Saint Petersburg → Kaliningrad → Dilijan (Armenia) → Subotica and Petrovaradin (Serbia). I’ve been in Serbia for a year now.

I switched to programming in 2016, but before that, I tried various things: from construction day laborer to founder of a meal kit delivery service.

Since then, I’ve worked in quite a few places. Not something to brag about, but the collection is pretty impressive 😅
- Noveo
- BlackDeckCrew ❤️
- Breadhead
- Semrush ❤️
- 12 Storeez
- Elbrus Bootcamp
- Vilantis
- HTML Academy ❤️
- XYRO.io ❤️

## ❤️

I love inventing my own things and giving them unique names. Here are a few examples:
- Martynak — a keyboard layout for those who find QWERTY frustrating
- Motion — a system for managing tasks and archiving life in Notion Obsidian
- Mideation — a meditation technique combined with journaling
- Pokoy — a meditation app for people with ADHD
- A thick stack of talks on everything I find interesting

## 💢💢💢

Since I was 10 (!), I’ve had a diagnosis of multiple sclerosis. It’s not about forgetfulness; it’s about an immune system that damages its own wiring. This sparked my interest in neurosciences, medicine, and cognition. I manage my illness and strive for stable, everlasting remission.

Additionally, I was diagnosed with ADHD in 2023. Unexpected, right? 😆 But I live with it 🤷‍♂️

I think these two diagnoses describe me better than my interests and projects.

## 🙃 Fun Facts 

- I’m obsessed with the number 13. 
- I turned 13 on Friday the 13th. 
- My cat’s name is Dopamine. I named him ten years before my ADHD diagnosis. - Once, I drank an octuple espresso and made a short film about it.
