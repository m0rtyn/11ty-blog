  👋 Hi, I'm Mártyn, literally a frontend developer and figuratively an artist.

  Some people know me as Vladimir Martynenko, but is so boring and official.

  I develop interfaces and make team processes better. Make talks and doing educational projects.

  You can reach me at [Telegram](https://t.me/m0rtyn)

## ℹ️ About me

I'm ~30. I make my living doing web interfaces and business automation.

I lived in Lensk (Yakutia) → Novosibirsk → St. Petersburg → Kaliningrad → Dilijan 🇦🇲. In the last place I live for the first year.

Went into programming in 2016, and before that I tried all sorts of things, from construction handyman to founder of culinary kit delivery.

And then I worked a lot of jobs. Not that it's something to be proud of, but the collection is awesome: *Noveo*, *BlackDeckCrew*, *Breadhead*, *GdeMaterial*, *Semrush*, *Kode*, *12 Storeez, Elbrus Bootcamp.*

Why so many things? Simple, my focus is on opportunity, not on maintaining the *status quo*. People like me are called "polymaths," "scanners," "changers," "ADHD-ers," "Zoomers," or whatever, but the main thing here is the thrill of discovery.

## ❤️ What I like

I love being in a state of "above myself." That's why I made blog
"So Meta". I also like to invent something of my own and give it names.
Here are examples:

- [Martynak](https://github.com/m0rtyn/martynak) — a keyboard layout for those who hate QWERTY
- Matadoro — an online-coworking method for procrastinators
- Motion — a system for running a life in Notion
- Mideation — a meditation technique with parallel journaling
- [Pokoy](http://pokoy.app) — a meditation app for impulsive minds

I also enjoy giving talks and lectures. I am always willing to speak on an interesting topic. You can 🎤 [read more here](https://someta.site/let-me-to-the-mic).

## 💢 What I hate

I've been diagnosed with *Multiple Sclerosis* since I was 10 years old. No, it's not about forgetfulness, it's about immunity that *spoils the wiring* between neurons. Hence the interest in neuroscience, medicine and thinking.

Coping with the disease and striving for a stable and endless remission. You can read about it ***[here](https://martyn-guru.netlify.app/papers/invalid-martyn)***

## 💻 My code

My projects are on [Github](https://github.com/m0rtyn). I try to extract individual pieces from my work and shape them into self-sufficient solutions, and you can give them a couple of stars for usefulness.
